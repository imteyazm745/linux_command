tr is an UNIX utility for translating, or deleting, or squeezing repeated characters. It will read from STDIN and write to STDOUT.

tr stands for translate.

Syntax
The syntax of tr command is:

$ tr [OPTION] SET1 [SET2]

1.Convert lower case to upper case

$ tr abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
i/p = thegeekstuff
o/p = THEGEEKSTUFF
or
$ tr [:lower:] [:upper:]
i/p = thegeekstuff
o/p = THEGEEKSTUFF
or
$ tr a-z A-Z
i/p = thegeekstuff
o/p =THEGEEKSTUFF

2. Translate braces into parenthesis

$ tr '{}' '()' < inputfile > outputfile

3. Translate white-space to tabs

$ echo "This is for testing" | tr [:space:] '\t'
This	is	for	testing

4. Squeeze repetition of characters using -s

if there are two are more spaces present continuously, then the previous command will translate each spaces to a tab as follows.

$ echo "This   is   for testing" | tr [:space:] '\t'
This			is			for	testing

We can use -s option to squeeze the repetition of characters.

$ echo "This   is   for testing" | tr -s [:space:] '\t'
This	is	for	testing

Similarly we can convert multiple continuous spaces with a single space

$ echo "This  is  for testing" | tr -s [:space:] ' '
This is for testing
 
5. Delete specified characters using -d option
tr can also be used to remove particular characters using -d option.

$ echo "the geek stuff" | tr -d 't'
he geek suff
To remove all the digits from the string, use

$ echo "my username is 432234" | tr -d [:digit:]
my username is

Also, if you like to delete lines from file, you can use sed d command.

6. Complement the sets using -c option
You can complement the SET1 using -c option. For example, to remove all characters except digits, you can use the following.

$ echo "my username is 432234" | tr -cd [:digit:]
432234

7. Remove all non-printable character from a file
The following command can be used to remove all non-printable characters from a file.

$ tr -cd [:print:] < file.txt

8. Join all the lines in a file into a single line
The below command will translate all newlines into spaces and make the result as a single line.

$ tr -s '\n' ' ' < file.txt
