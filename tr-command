tr is an UNIX utility for translating, or deleting, or squeezing repeated characters. It will read from STDIN and write to STDOUT.

tr stands for translate.

Syntax
The syntax of tr command is:

$ tr [OPTION] SET1 [SET2]

1.Convert lower case to upper case

$ tr abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
i/p = thegeekstuff
o/p = THEGEEKSTUFF
or
$ tr [:lower:] [:upper:]
i/p = thegeekstuff
o/p = THEGEEKSTUFF
or
$ tr a-z A-Z
i/p = thegeekstuff
o/p =THEGEEKSTUFF

2. Translate braces into parenthesis

$ tr '{}' '()' < inputfile > outputfile

3. Translate white-space to tabs

$ echo "This is for testing" | tr [:space:] '\t'
This	is	for	testing

if there are two are more spaces present continuously, then the previous command will translate each spaces to a tab as follows.

$ echo "This   is   for testing" | tr [:space:] '\t'
This			is			for	testing

We can use -s option to squeeze the repetition of characters.

$ echo "This   is   for testing" | tr -s [:space:] '\t'
This	is	for	testing

Similarly we can convert multiple continuous spaces with a single space

$ echo "This  is  for testing" | tr -s [:space:] ' '
This is for testing
