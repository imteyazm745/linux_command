# Given two integers, X and Y , find their sum, difference, product, and quotient
# Four lines containing the sum (X+Y), difference (X-Y), product (X*Y), and quotient (X/Y), respectively.
# (While computing the quotient, print only the integer part.)

read X
read Y
echo $((X+Y))
echo $((X-Y))
echo $((X*Y))
echo $((X/Y))
