The uniq command in Linux is a command-line utility that reports or filters out the repeated lines in a file. 
In simple words, uniq is the tool that helps to detect the adjacent duplicate lines and also deletes the duplicate lines.
Syntax of uniq Command : 
$uniq [OPTION] [INPUT[OUTPUT]]
Here, INPUT refers to the input file in which repeated lines need to be filtered out and if INPUT isn’t specified then uniq reads from the standard input. OUTPUT refers to the output file in which you can store the filtered output generated by uniq command and as in the case of INPUT 
if OUTPUT isn’t specified then uniq writes to the standard output. 

//displaying contents of kt.txt//

$cat kt.txt
I love music.
I love music.
I love music.

I love music of Kartik.
I love music of Kartik.

Thanks.

Now, as we can see that the above file contains multiple duplicate lines. Now, lets’ use uniq command to remove them: 
 

//...using uniq command.../

$uniq kt.txt
I love music.

I love music of Kartik.

Thanks.

/* with the use of uniq all
the repeated lines are removed*/
