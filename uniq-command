The uniq command in Linux is a command-line utility that reports or filters out the repeated lines in a file. 
In simple words, uniq is the tool that helps to detect the adjacent duplicate lines and also deletes the duplicate lines.
Syntax of uniq Command : 
$uniq [OPTION] [INPUT[OUTPUT]]
Here, INPUT refers to the input file in which repeated lines need to be filtered out and if INPUT isn’t specified then uniq reads from the standard input. OUTPUT refers to the output file in which you can store the filtered output generated by uniq command and as in the case of INPUT 
if OUTPUT isn’t specified then uniq writes to the standard output. 

//displaying contents of kt.txt//

$cat kt.txt
I love music.
I love music.
I love music.

I love music of Kartik.
I love music of Kartik.

Thanks.

Now, as we can see that the above file contains multiple duplicate lines. Now, lets’ use uniq command to remove them: 
 

//...using uniq command.../

$uniq kt.txt
I love music.

I love music of Kartik.

Thanks.

/* with the use of uniq all
the repeated lines are removed*/
Note: uniq isn’t able to detect the duplicate lines unless they are adjacent to each other. The content in the file must be therefore sorted before using uniq or you can simply use sort -u instead of uniq command. 

Options For uniq Command: 
 

-c – -count : It tells how many times a line was repeated by displaying a number as a prefix with the line.
-d – -repeated : It only prints the repeated lines and not the lines which aren’t repeated.
-D – -all-repeated[=METHOD] : It prints all duplicate lines and METHOD can be any of the following: 
none : Do not delimit duplicate lines at all. This is the default.
prepend : Insert a blank line before each set of duplicated lines.
separate : Insert a blank line between each set of duplicated lines.
-f N – -skip-fields(N) : It allows you to skip N fields(a field is a group of characters, delimited by whitespace) of a line before determining the uniqueness of a line.
-i – -ignore case : By default, comparisons done are case sensitive but with this option case insensitive comparisons can be made.
-s N – -skip-chars(N) : It doesn’t compare the first N characters of each line while determining uniqueness. This is like the -f option, but it skips individual characters rather than fields.
-u – -unique : It allows you to print only unique lines.
-z – -zero-terminated : It will make a line end with 0 bytes (NULL), instead of a newline.
-w N – -check-chars(N) : It only compares N characters in a line.
– – help : It displays a help message and exit.
– – version : It displays version information and exit.
